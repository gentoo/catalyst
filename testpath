# edit the following 2 paths to point to your caatalyst git checkout
# then in a terminal window you wish to run the git code in...
# cd ~/catalyst
# source ./testpath
# edit a config file "test.conf" with similar path changes for it to find
# and use/run the git checkout code and to store it's data to a test directory
# it can then be run on a system without being installed or replacing an existing
# catalyst install which may be used for production.
#
# then run catalyst from there
#  eg:
#
# catalyst -c ./test.conf -p  -f stage1.spec
