##GREETING

We hope to provide you with the best experience possible, so if you have any
questions regarding the installation process, Gentoo in general, or simply want
to become an active part of the Gentoo community, please feel free to utilize
the following resources:

IRC: irc.freenode.net, #gentoo

Mailing Lists: Please see our quick Mailing List HOWTO at:
<http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/lists.xml>

Gentoo user forums: <http://forums.gentoo.org>

Gentoo Bug Database: <http://bugs.gentoo.org>

On this LiveCD, we've provided a minimal IRC client called "irssi" and a simple
text web browser called "links." Both can be accessed via the command line by
typing either 'irssi' or 'links $url'.
 
Don't forget to check out the Gentoo Installation Handbook, available both on
the LiveCD and the Web. On this LiveCD, the Handbook can be found at
'/mnt/cdrom/docs/handbook', and the latest version of the Handbook is viewable at the
following URL: <http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook.xml>.

Thank you again for choosing Gentoo!
