##GREETING

The root password on this system has been auto-scrambled for security.

If any ethernet adapters were detected at boot, they should be auto-configured
if DHCP is available on your network.  Type "net-setup eth0" to specify eth0 IP
address settings by hand. 

/proc/config(.gz) for kernel configuration.

To start an ssh server on this system, type "/etc/init.d/sshd start".  If you
need to log in remotely as root, type "passwd root" to reset root's password to
a known value.

Stage tarball(s), distfiles and packages can be found in /mnt/cdrom/.
