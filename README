What is Catalyst?
========================

Catalyst is the Gentoo Linux project's release building tool. With catalyst,
you are able to completely customize your Gentoo install by customizing
the very tools you install your system with.

Catalyst is capable of:

-Building installation stages for every architecutre supported by Gentoo.
-Building bootable LiveCDs for every architecture supported by Gentoo.
-Building GRP (Gentoo Reference Platform) sets for every architecture supported by Gentoo.
-Setting up a Tinderbox target for test building.

Configuring catalyst
========================

After emerging catalyst, the first thing (and probably only thing)
that you will have to do is edit /etc/catalyst.conf to your liking.

Example catalyst.conf:

distdir="/usr/portage/distfiles"
options="ccache pkgcache"
sharedir="/usr/share/catalyst/modules"

There are many more options that can be set, but those defaults are good
for out of the box operation. For more documentation on what you can do
with catalyst, please check the man page or the online documentation at
<http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/releng/catalyst>.
