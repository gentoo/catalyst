DESIGN REMARKS
--------------

- arch/ is perfect (strategy design pattern)

- Catalyst 

  idea:

  PRE:    Valid configuration (correct command line options, configuration file,...) 
  OK:     Run target defined in configuration
  NOT OK: Show usage, version, display exception and stop program

  Suggestions: 
  	- create a catalyst configuration class (proxy design pattern), in its constructor 
	  it parses sys.argv, returns a new object with configuration set, throw an exception
	  if an error occurred. Preferably in a new file. This allows to migrate for instance
	  to XML configuration later on, still allowing for the older format.
	- global variables are not a good idea because they could be more easily overridden 
	  unintentionally by a module.

- spec/examples/kconfig:

  Suggestions: 
  	- Kernel .configs in examples/livecd and kconfig should be removed, as this is the 
	  responsibility of genkernel?
   	- Spec files in examples should be listed in spec/

- examples/livecd:

  Is there a reason this needs to be done in shell script rather than with a python class 
  inheritance structure? I'm ok with reinventing inheritance using 'case' should something 
  be required that cannot be realized using python. In any case, much needs to be improved:

  chroot ${blabla} /bin/bash << EOF
	body
EOF

  is prone to errors because people tend to use variables from outside the chroot in the body.
  This also destroys indentation, and prevents reuse. A much better technique is the one used 
  in the livecd script used by ppc (gentoo/users/pvdabeel/livecd):

  ${_VARS_} chroot ${blabla} /livecd/install-kernel.sh
  ${_VARS_} chroot ${blabla} /livecd/install-packages.sh
  ${_VARS_} chroot ${blabla} /livecd/remove-packages.sh
  ${_VARS_} chroot ${blabla} /livecd/hard-cleanup.sh
  ${_VARS_} chroot ${blabla} /livecd/configure-runlevels.sh

  This technique allows to define several tasks that need to be run inside the chroot. This is
  very usefull: a kde/gnome livecd could feature an extra customize-desktop.sh task. 

  Also, what happens with the mounts in the runscript on CTRL-C? 

  Emerge genkernel fails for users needing a PROXY. the ${_VARS_} before the chroot allows one
  to solve that problem. (same for ccache, distcc, cflags...). No need to write an if then else
  for each of them.

- files:
  Should be considered specs.

- modules/targets.py:
  A target file for each target class, comments needed for each class. 
  Generic_stage_target contains hardcoded data that should be provided in the specs (targetmap,
  machinemap)

- modules/targets.py <-> targets/
 
  The remark about chroot applies. The technique is illustrated in the ppc livecd script.
  The targets/ definitely need a cleanup (is livecd/livecd.sh used?). zapmost is never called.
  Have only looked at the livecd part. Stage part needs rework, e.g: stage1 still uses packages.build
  rather than a spec file?

RUNTIME REMARKS
---------------

Variables format in /etc/catalyst.conf differs from other gentoo config files. A common approach is needed.

There is catalyst stuff in make.conf: GRP_STAGE23_USE, does a package know when it is rebuild whether is should
use these USE flags rather than those set in usr/portage/profiles/.../make.defaults? This should become a spec.

How to declare proxy settings to catalyst?

Specs use different settings than config

The availability of a snapshot is a pre-requirement for both stages/grp and livecd. PRE requirements should
be checked before doing work such as unpacking the stage. (remember: user leaves computer and returns the day
after and sees no snapshot was available.) 

Incremental building requirement for livecds. If building the kernel failed in the live environment, there is no 
need to unpack the stage3 again, install the kernel again. We only need to reconfigure it. PPC livecd scripts 
behave like this. This allows to CTRL-C the livecd building, chroot into the live environment, make a few changes
and restart the script. (trick is to touch files on specific milestones).

I still don't know what livecd-stage1, stage2 stage3 is supposed to do. Comments/instructions needed.

Building custom livecds such as the kde/gnome cd might involve running an extra script inside the live environment
(to modify motd, issue, ...). See design remarks about targets and ppc livecd script.
