  15 Oct 2003; zhen <zhen@gentoo.org> targets/stage3/stage3.sh:
  All preliminary target build scripts are now added and coded to near as spec
  that we can have at this point.

  14 Oct 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobins@gentoo.org>: new and improved ChangeLog;
  snapshots now work ("./catalyst-util.py snap 20031014",) and snapshotting cleans
  up after itself (temp files deleted,) something that should be continued as
  much as reasonably possible in other parts of catalyst. Also, we have 
  /etc/catalyst.conf config file reading stub code completed, and internal fall-backs
  to reasonable global config defaults completed.
