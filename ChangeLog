  kde/gnome cd specs added.

  18 Feb 2004; John Davis <zhen@gentoo.org> files/catalyst.conf:
  fix in catalyst.conf for bug #42044

  arch/sparc64.py, examples/livecd/runscript/sparc64-archscript.sh,
  examples/livecd/sparc64/config-2.4.24-sparc64:
  sparc fixups contributed by Gustavo Zacarias <gustavoz@gentoo.org>

  12 Feb 2004; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: fixed bugs in previous
  feature additions (see 11 Feb 2004) and added support for a $clst_conf 
  environment variable. You can use the $clst_conf variable to point to
  a file to use in place of /etc/catalyst.conf. By setting this variable
  in your shell, catalyst can easily be used by multiple people on the
  same machine. Also, ccache support now works for genkernel.
  
  11 Feb 2004; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: removed file for
  livecd-stage2 target, as this is handled by the runscript now. Added support
  for "/boot/kernel/foo/use", "/boot/kernel/foo/packages," and made
  "/boot/kernel/foo/extraversion" an optional rather than required parameter.
  The aforementioned "packages" is used to specify kernel-related packages
  (like module ebuilds) to merge with each kernel, and the new "use" option is
  used to specify the USE settings you'd like exported to the environment
  during kernel as well as kernel "packages" build.

  10 Feb 2004; John Davis <zhen@gentoo.org> README, TODO, catalyst,
  modules/builder.py, modules/catalyst_support.py, modules/targets.py,

  targets/livecd-stage2/livecd-stage2.sh, targets/stage1/stage1-chroot.sh,
  targets/stage2/stage2.sh, targets/stage3/stage3.sh,
  targets/tinderbox/tinderbox.sh:
  added envscripts support (fixes bug #39832) massive cleanup of tree to prepare
  it for ebuild - added headers to everything and removed deprecated dirs

  14 Jan 2004; zhen <zhen@gentoo.org> arch/mips.py, modules/targets.py:
  adding Kumba's patches for MIPS

  16 Dec 2003; Guy Martin <gmsoft@gentoo.org> : arch/hppa.py,modules/targets.py :
  Added hppa specific code.

  29 Nov 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: Tinderbox target added. See
  tinderbox examples in examples/ dir.
  
  08 Nov 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: spec file support integrated
  into catalyst. Use "-f/--file specfile" as argument; see examples dir for examples.
  "grp" target now functional. See examples/x86-grp-20031102.spec for an example of
  how to use it.
 
  08 Nov 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: support functions for spec
  file parsing and reading added. Will get added to the code soon.
  
  05 Nov 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: Many bug fixes later, things
  seem to be working well for stage1/2/3 so I've added a README.
  
  28 Oct 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: Significant rework of code
  structure. Everything is falling nicely into place.
  
  28 Oct 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: Exception handling fully-
  integrated into current prototype code.
  
  27 Oct 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: beginning of exception
  handling integration, got some of the target code nicely fleshed out.
  
  24 Oct 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: major code rework in 
  progress on the python parts.
  
  17 Oct 2003; zhen <zhen@gentoo.org> files/grp/x86/x86.conf,
  files/grp/x86/x86.pkg.cd1, files/grp/x86/x86.pkg.cd2, files/grp/x86/x86.src,
  files/livecd/x86-basic/base.pkg, files/livecd/x86-basic/kern.pkg:
  for organiation's sake, I have moved the files, such as livecd foundations,
  into catalyst/files. It will make it easier for us when ebuild time comes
  around.

  15 Oct 2003; zhen <zhen@gentoo.org> targets/stage3/stage3.sh:
  All preliminary target build scripts are now added and coded to near as spec
  that we can have at this point.

  14 Oct 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobins@gentoo.org>: new and improved ChangeLog;
  snapshots now work ("./catalyst-util.py snap 20031014",) and snapshotting
  cleans up after itself (temp files deleted,) something that should be
  continued as much as reasonably possible in other parts of catalyst. Also, we
  have /etc/catalyst.conf config file reading stub code completed, and internal
  fall-backs to reasonable global config defaults completed.
