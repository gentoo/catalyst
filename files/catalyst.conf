# Simple desriptions of catalyst settings. Please refer to the online
# documentation for more information.

# distdir specifies where your distfiles are located. This setting should
# work fine for most default installations.
distdir="/usr/portage/distfiles"

# options set different build-time options for catalyst. Some examples are:
# ccache = enables build time ccache support (highly recommended)
# distcc = enable distcc support for building. You have to set distcc_hosts in
#	your spec file.
# pkgcache = keeps a tbz2 of every built package (useful if your build stops
#	prematurely)
# kerncache = keeps a tbz2 of your built kernel and modules (useful if your
#	build stops in livecd-stage2)
# seedcache = use the build output of a previous target if it exists to speed up 
#	the copy
# snapcache = cache the snapshot so that it can be bind-mounted into the chroot.
options="pkgcache kerncache"

# sharedir specifies where all of the catalyst runtime executables are. Most
# users do not need to change this.
sharedir="/usr/lib/catalyst"

# storedir specifies where catalyst will store everything that it builds, and
# also where it will put its temporary files and caches.
storedir="/var/tmp/catalyst"

# snapshot_cache specifies where the snapshots will be cached to if snapcache is
# enabled in the options.
# snapshot_cache="<path_to_new_cache_dir>"

# envscript allows users to set options such as http proxies, MAKEOPTS,
# GENTOO_MIRRORS, or any other environment variables needed for building.
# The envscript file sets environment variables like so:
# export FOO="bar"

#envscript="/root/catalyst-env.sh"
