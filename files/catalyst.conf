# Simple desriptions of catalyst settings. Please refer to the online
# documentation for more information.

# distdir specifies where your distfiles are located. This setting should
# work fine for most default installations.
distdir="/usr/portage/distfiles"

# options set different build-time options for catalyst. Some examples are:
# ccache = enables build time ccache support (highly recommended)
# distcc = enable distcc support for building. You have to set distcc_hosts in
#	your spec file.
# pkgcache = keeps a tbz2 of every built package (useful if your build stops
#	prematurely)
# kerncache = keeps a tbz2 of your built kernel and modules (useful if your
#	build stops in livecd-stage2)
options="ccache pkgcache kerncache"

# sharedir specifies where all of the catalyst runtime executables are. Most users do
# not need to change this.
sharedir="/usr/lib/catalyst"

# envscript allows users to set options such as http proxies, MAKEOPTS, GENTOO_MIRRORS,
# or any other environment variables needed for building.
# The envscript file sets environment variables like so:
# export FOO="bar"

#envscript="/root/catalyst-env.sh"
