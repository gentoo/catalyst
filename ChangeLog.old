  12 Oct 2003; Daniel Robbins <drobins@gentoo.org>: subarch test outsourced to
  python catalyst-subarches function.
  
  12 Oct 2003; zhen <zhen@gentoo.org> include/build_functions.sh: fixed the
  entry in include/build_functions.sh for location of bootstrap.sh

  12 Oct 2003; zhen <zhen@gentoo.org> catalyst:
  removing dup enter_chroot

  12 Oct 2003; Robin H. Johnson <robbat2@gentoo.org> catalyst:
  document subarches checking

  12 Oct 2003; Robin H. Johnson <robbat2@gentoo.org> catalyst:
  Fix valid subarch test.

  12 Oct 2003; zhen <zhen@gentoo.org> catalyst, include/build_functions.sh,
  include/functions.sh:
  thanks to robbat2, the cmdline argument handling is now fixed. I moved
  start_build to build_functions.sh cleaning up the main catalyst script some
  more.

  11 Oct 2003; <zhen@gentoo.org> include/build_functions.sh:
  fixed SRCBALL and DESTBALL, making it transparent for profiles

  11 Oct 2003; <zhen@gentoo.org> catalyst, include/functions.sh:
  added an exit condition to the cmd line argument case statement

  09 Oct 2003; <zhen@gentoo.org> catalyst, bin/build.sh, bin/stage1,
  files/catalyst.conf, include/build_functions.sh, include/functions.sh:
  the changes that I made to the above files should make catalyst completely
  transparent to no matter what profile we are using. check files/catalyst.conf
  for the list of BUILDTYPEs that we support.

  08 Oct 2003; zhen <zhen@gentoo.org> catalyst:
  changed how cmd line arguments are handled

  08 Oct 2003; zhen <zhen@gentoo.org> catalyst:
  I changed the is_special handling so that it is cleaner and faster

  08 Oct 2003; zhen <zhen@gentoo.org> catalyst, include/functions.sh,
  livecd/foundations/x86-basic/base.pkg,
  livecd/foundations/x86-basic/kern.pkg,
  livecd/foundations/x86-basic/post-clean.sh,
  livecd/foundations/x86-basic/pre-clean.sh,
  livecd/foundations/x86-basic/settings:
  I outsourced more functions to include/functions.sh. I made it a seperate file
  from build_fucntions.sh so that we can keep our build and other functions
  apart. I also added in the livecd stuffs from the stager side of things.

  08 Oct 2003; zhen <zhen@gentoo.org> catalyst, include/build_functions.sh:
  I outsourced all of the build functions to include/build_functions.sh. In the
  future, this will happen more - the code needs cleaned up.

  07 Oct 2003; zhen <zhen@gentoo.org> catalyst, bin/bootstrap.sh, bin/stage1:
  I mucked with stage1 and bootstrap.sh to add support for ${BUILDTYPE} (profile
  transparency). Also, I removed gettext from bootstrap, since mainline gentoo
  does not use that anymore.

  05 Oct 2003; zhen <zhen@gentoo.org> catalyst:
  since we now have a default profile in portage, i massaged some errors
  messages to reflect that.

  04 Oct 2003; zhen <zhen@gentoo.org> catalyst, bin/bootstrap.sh, bin/stage1:
  removed ccache support from catalyst stage1 build cause it breaks the build.
  Additionally, I removed gettext support from bootstrap, because according to
  our new default profile, we don't use that anymore.

  02 Oct 2003; zhen <zhen@gentoo.org> catalyst, files/catalyst.conf:
  added a new var, BUILDTYPE, adding more transparency for building.
  In the future, we will be building both selinux and hardened sources.

  02 Oct 2003; zhen <zhen@gentoo.org> catalyst:
  fixed some formatting when catalyst prints out build info, additionally,
  trying to make catalyst more transparent for future expansion of stages

  21 Sep 2003; <zhen@gentoo.org> catalyst:
  fixed the order/ way in which we handle cmd line arguments wrt to -h or
  --help. I moved this functionality from the main program section to
  prechecks().

  21 Sep 2003; <zhen@gentoo.org> README.catalyst, catalyst:
  I edited catalyst to change our naming convention from stage*-arch-h.* to
  stage*-arch-etdyn-ssp.* re method's request. This will not be the first time
  I change naming conventions, as catalyst will be eventually extended to
  do selinux-* stages also.
  
  Additionally, I updated README.catalyst to include profile information.

  10 Sep 2003; <zhen@gentoo.org> README.catalyst, README.stager, bin/catalyst,
  bin/hardened-bootstrap.sh, bin/stage1:
  I renamed README.stager to README.catalyst and have made some very minor
  changes to it. bin/bootstrap.sh has been renamed to bin/hardened-bootstrap.sh.
  I have hacked bootstrap to use the hardened profile, as well as utilize
  hardened-gcc. bin/catalyst itself has undergone some more changes (nothing too
  major). Additionally, bin/stage1 has been hacked to accept the hardened profile,
  and use hardened-gcc.

  09 September 2003; John Davis <zhen@gentoo.org>: Initial import of hardened stager.
  I am forking this from the original stager code in order to better fit our needs.
  The original stager code is still used by Gentoo, and is maintained by Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>.
  I would like to thank him and the rest of the contributors that coded stager.
